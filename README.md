Simple calculator app

## How to run

Open the index.html file on a browser

## Improvements to make

- [ ] Make the UI pretty
- [ ] Negative sign for negative numbers appears on the screen (currently hidden as treated like an operator in the sum)
- [ ] Make sure that stringing operators does not lead to an error, and instead just ignored
- [ ] Figure out why NPM and module importing doesn't work
